However, learning never stopped at the classroom door for me. I constantly found myself exploring things outside the curriculum—tinkering with code, reading philosophy, dabbling in art, and absorbing knowledge from wherever I could find it. I believe that a well-rounded mind comes from being open to different disciplines and letting them intersect naturally.
Over the years, I’ve embraced challenges as growth opportunities. Whether I was moving to a new city, starting a new project, or stepping into a leadership role, I’ve always believed that getting uncomfortable is a prerequisite for becoming more capable. My personal values—authenticity, resilience, and a desire to contribute meaningfully—guide every step I take.
Even though I've learned to work independently, I genuinely enjoy collaboration. I find great joy in connecting with people who think differently, who inspire me to expand my understanding and see the world through different lenses. I see myself not just as a "specialist" in one area, but as someone who thrives in the spaces where different fields meet.
